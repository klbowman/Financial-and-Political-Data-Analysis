# Financial and Political Data Analysis 

Python scripts that analyze CSV datasets. 

## PyBank: Financial Data Analysis 

The PyBank directory is designed to analyze financial records. Budget data (i.e., Date, Profit/Losses) is stored in the Resources directory (budget_data.csv), and the Python script (main.py) calculates the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes
- The greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The script prints the analysis to the terminal, and exports a text file with the results (Analysis/PyBank_ResultsSummary.txt).

## PyPoll: Poll Data Analysis 

The PyPoll directory is designed to count votes and analyze poll results for a small town. Poll data (i.e., Voter ID, County, Candidate) is stored in the Resources directory (election_data.csv), and the Python script (main.py) calculates the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script prints the analysis to the terminal, and exports a text file with the results (Analysis/PyPoll_ResultsSummary.txt).
